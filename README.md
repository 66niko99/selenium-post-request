# Selenium Http Requests
## Uses seleniums javascript executor to create a form on the page with your payload, and then submit it. 

Create a copy of [selenium_post.py](https://github.com/66niko99/selenium-post-request/blob/main/selenium_post.py) in the root of your project. Then simply import it into your file and use `selenium_post.post`.

See [example.py](https://github.com/66niko99/selenium-post-request/blob/main/example.py) for example code.
